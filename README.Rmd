# qre

In classic game theory, the Nash Equilibrium concept assumes that players are perfectly rational and will always choose the strategy that maximizes their payoff, given their opponents' actions. However, empirical studies of human behavior show that players often make mistakes. The Quantal Response Equilibrium (QRE) is a widely used model that relaxes the assumption of perfect rationality by introducing probabilistic choice. The goal of qre is to solve for the QRE of a game by finding the rationality parameter, lambda, that best explains a set of observed outcomes. Additionally, "plot" s3 object helps users visualize and assess the model's fit.

## Installation

You can install the development version of qre from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("soh24-bit/qre")
```

## What's Left?

I still have to implement the "plot" s3 object and organize the roxygen skeleton better.

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.
